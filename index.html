<h1>Project 3</h1>
<a href="https://youtu.be/djjIK07FblU">Bouncing Ball Animation</a><br><br>
<img src="story.png" alt="storyboard"><br><br>
Principles of Animation:
 <ul>
  <li><b>Squash and Stretch</b> - the ball stretches during strong movements and squashes to absorb impacts</li>
  <li><b>Anticipation</b> - both the ball and the cow squash before an important movement is performed,<br>for example the cow getting startled and the camera shaking before the big ball is on screen</li>
  <li><b>Staging</b> - no two characters move on screen at the same time. There is at least a 1 frame gap between actions.<br>All object of interests lie on the thirds of the camera</li>
  <li><b>Slow-In and Slow-Out</b> - Ease in and ease out are used for most movements. Cud has more frames on the<br>downswingthan the upswing, indicating slower and faster movement</li>
  <li><b>Follow-Through and Overlapping Action</b> - the cow's head leads the body, giving the feeling of<br> a main and a proceding action. The cow overshoots the turn around for a frame and snaps back to its intended pose.<br>The ball follows through its jump by rolling a short distance afterwards</li>
  <li><b>Arc</b> - the ball moves in a parabolic tragectory. The cow's startle and ball's startle is on the same arc
</ul>
Beyond the 12:
<ul>
  <li>Gravity and friction have quadratic curves, character "muscle" movement has cubic curves</li>
  <li>Follow through must conserve energy</li>
  <li>Small characters move faster than larger ones</li>
  <li>Squash and stretch strength conveys material</li>
  <li>Unless heavy, smaller objects have less traction than larger ones. Balance with inertia</li>
  <li>Prioritize staging on screen than real location. Use forced perspective or different focal lengths if necessary</li>
</ul>
