</a>
<a href="https://youtu.be/djjIK07FblU">Bouncing Ball Animation</a><br><br>
<img src="story.png" alt="storyboard"><br><br>
Principles of Animation:
 <ul>
  <li><b>Squash and Stretch</b> - the ball stretches during strong movements and squashes to absorb impacts</li>
  <li><b>Anticipation</b> - both the ball and the cow squash before an important movement is performed,<br>for example the cow getting startled and the camera shaking before the big ball is on screen</li>
  <li><b>Staging</b> - no two characters move on screen at the same time. There is at least a 1 frame gap between actions.<br>All object of interests lie on the thirds of the camera</li>
  <li><b>Slow-In and Slow-Out</b> - Ease in and ease out are used for most movements. Cud has more frames on the<br>downswingthan the upswing, indicating slower and faster movement</li>
  <li><b>Follow-Through and Overlapping Action</b> - the cow's head leads the body, giving the feeling of<br> a main and a proceding action. The cow overshoots the turn around for a frame and snaps back to its intended pose.<br>The ball follows through its jump by rolling a short distance afterwards</li>
  <li><b>Arc</b> - the ball moves in a parabolic tragectory. The cow's startle and ball's startle is on the same arc
</ul>
Beyond the 12:
<ul>
  <li>Gravity and friction have quadratic curves, character "muscle" movement has cubic curves</li>
  <li>Follow through must conserve energy</li>
  <li>Small characters move faster than larger ones</li>
  <li>Squash and stretch strength conveys material</li>
  <li>Unless heavy, smaller objects have less traction than larger ones. Balance with inertia</li>
  <li>Prioritize staging on screen than real location. Use forced perspective or different focal lengths if necessary</li>
</ul>

The domino coloring was achieved by creating a new face on a generated polyCube, not extruding it all, selecting the<br>
new vertices by array slicing, and setting the weight colors to 2 distinguisable colors. The data cannot proliferate<br>
throughout a MASH network, so the code also has some functionality to transfer the vertex weights from the parent domino<br>
to all others in the grid.<br>

<h1>Final Project (5/18)</h1>

This animation is a demonstration of an in-development shader for the fast rendering of cartoon/anime style 3D objects<br>
in a way that unifies the look of hand-drawn digital draughtsmanship and digital rendering.<br><br>
The model (the fighter jet) responds dynamically the position, intensity and color of moving light sources in the ACES colorspace<br>
to increase the feeling of a wider dynamic brightness range than current industry methods. The model is also affected<br>
by global illumination without the intervention of the artist. All lights are handled in a cel-shaded style with gradients<br>
for added depth and detail in the lighting while maintaining the illusion of a hand-drawn object. Black linework is rendered before<br>
post-procressing effects for further adjustment.<br>

The effect of global illumination on the overcast scene is quite minimal, but can be better exploited in other lighting<br>
scenarios

This stands in contrast to the current paradigm of selecting exclusively 2 colors for cel-shading (one lit and one shadow color)<br>
with heavy post-procressing for increase appeal/detail, which at times can look quite primitive.<br><br>

Other Things of Note - The main jet model is dynamical deformed to create an illusion of flatness, eliminating a great<br>
deal of perspective distortion and adds a subtle amount of imperfection to the model, giving it a hand-crafted look.<br>

Also, a variable frame rate was experimented with in my video for the purposes of mimicking the cost<br>
cutting techniques of old, thus leading to a more believable hand-drawn animation with the timing of a human, not a machine. The pattern<br>
to fully achieve this effect requires further investigation<br><br>

Complications - The models for both the jet and the smoke trails were carefully modeled to minimize lighting artifacts<br>
caused by rough normal interpolation. In isolation, either elements worked fine, but in tandem, especially the smoke trails mixed<br>
with booleans, created multiple days worth of bugs and delays. A future approach may be to tackle the unique shading of the<br>
trails with textures rather than very complexe geometry

Principles of Animation:
 <ul>
  <li><b>Squash and Stretch</b> - smear frames are used to express extreme motion</li>
		<img src="smear.jpg" alt="storyboard" height="200px"><br>
  <li><b>Anticipation</b> - sonic boom condensation cone preceed appearance of jet. Jet movements start with a small wind-up in the opposite direction</li>
		<img src="0016.png" alt="storyboard" height="200px"><br>
  <li><b>Staging</b> - the camera follows the main objects in motion</li>
  <li><b>Slow-In and Slow-Out</b> - Ease in and ease out are used for most movements.</li>
 
</ul>
